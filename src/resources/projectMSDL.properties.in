# Two fullscreen modes are supported:
# - windowed: Uses a borderless window, filling the current monitor.
#             Does not change the current resolution.
# - exclusive: Sets the resolution to window.fullscreen.width/height and runs in exclusive mode,
#              like a game.

# If any value is set to 0, the nearest available fullscreen resolution for the current window size is used.
